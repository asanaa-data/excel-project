Financial Data Analytics Cumulative Project
As a Data Analyst tasked with analyzing financial data to provide insights and recommendations for improving budget performance and identifying cost-saving opportunities. 
My goal is to track revenue, expenses, and profits across different product categories and regions using the financial dataset. The insights derived from the analysis will inform decision-making and strategic planning for future budgeting.
